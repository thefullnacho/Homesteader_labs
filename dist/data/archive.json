The `bunker-uplink` tunnel now guarantees a persistent link to the outside world, eliminating the flaky nature of serverless timeouts.\n\n### Current Status:\n- Stripe webhooks fire directly to our self-hosted node.\n- The **Meshtastic Bridge** is operational, allowing low-power communication with other mesh nodes.\n\nTo visualize the server load, we can embed a live component:\n\n<ServerStatusLight process=\"bunker-core\" status=\"Online\" />\n\n---\n// End of Log 005",
