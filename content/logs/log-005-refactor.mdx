The transition to the Waterford Node is complete. The system now operates on a secure, decentralized stack.

## System Notes
We successfully separated the transaction logic from the front-end interface, creating a reliable fulfillment service. The `bunker-uplink` tunnel now guarantees a persistent link to the outside world, eliminating the flaky nature of serverless timeouts.

### Current Status:
- Stripe webhooks fire directly to our self-hosted node.
- The **Meshtastic Bridge** is operational, allowing low-power communication with other mesh nodes.

To visualize the server load, we can embed a live component:

<ServerStatusLight process="bunker-core" status="Online" />
